## Planned for next week

* Continue refining prototype, taking user feedback into consideration.

## Risks, challenges, and issues

* Originally we'd interviewed too few users due to a communication mixup.
  We solved this by identifying new users before the end of the last week.
* We've identified more non-critical bugs, but these are an artifact of
  this site being a prototype and not a fully-featured web application.
